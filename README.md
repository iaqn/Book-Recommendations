### History Book Recommendations

- **Book Title:** *unspoken rules: the true history of the game in China*
- **Author:** WU SI
- **Recommendation:** This book by Wu Si provides valuable insights. It reveals the often concealed truths within the framework of contemporary education. Future generations would benefit greatly from this knowledge. Be sure to read the original edition without any redactions.
- >"If modern people are willing to dig deeper, they can still find knowledge about the hidden rules of bureaucratic operations in unofficial historical records of the Ming and Qing dynasties. These include insights on smuggling, bribing customs and naval forces, and managing conflicts among different smuggling groups. Smugglers and bribe-takers who study this well can avoid mistakes like those in the 'Yuanhua Case.' Officials who oversee enforcement could also learn to curb corruption effectively. Leaders concerned about China's future may gain valuable lessons, even paving the way for systemic reform to prevent the recurring pitfalls seen throughout dynasties from Qin and Han to Ming and Qing." (Excerpt from the original text)

### 历史类书籍推荐

- **书名：** 潜规则：中国历史中的真实游戏
- **作者：** 吴思
- **理由** 吴思所写的这一本书，令人收获颇丰。当代教育的本质往往隐没于这些阴影。望后来者多鉴！一定要看原版，不要看未删减版。
- >其实，现代人如果肯下功夫，关于官场运作实况的潜规则的知识还是可以找到的，明清野史中甚至还有如何走私，如何收买"海关"和"水师"， 如何处理不同走私团伙的利益冲突的知识。走私者和受贿者学习好了，可 以少犯"远华"案中的错误。监察者学习好了，可以更有效地扬汤止沸。为中国的前途命运操心的领导人学习好了，更可以来个釜底抽薪，彻底改良土壤，免蹈从秦汉到明清历代王朝都绕不开的覆辙。我想，这就是我写本书的目的。(引自原文)
